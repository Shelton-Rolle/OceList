# OceList 1.0
This was my first attempt at building OceList, a platform that provides developers with a variety of Open Source projects to discover.

I made this repository public to 1. Maybe get feedback on the initial idea and 2. to showcase what was done. I put a lot of work and planning into the inital build and it has a lot more functionality than the current OceList, but the idea just wasn't viable at the time since it relied on users adding their projects.

### Technologies
- NextJS
- Typescript
